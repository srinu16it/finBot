# News Sentiment Fix Documentation

## ✅ Issue Fixed: News Sentiment Now Working!

### The Problem
Your curl command showed news data was available:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=NEWS_SENTIMENT&tickers=NVDA&apikey=MYKYNF7L9MR0AMX9"
```

But the app showed: "No news sentiment data available"

### The Root Cause
The `_process_news_sentiment` function had a bug where it was looking for the ticker symbol in the wrong place:
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
if ts.get('ticker') == data.get('tickers'):  # data has no 'tickers' key!

# AFTER (Fixed):
if ts.get('ticker') == symbol:  # Now correctly uses the symbol parameter
```

### What's Fixed
1. **News API Call**: Works correctly with your API key
2. **Data Processing**: Now properly matches articles to the requested ticker
3. **Sentiment Calculation**: Correctly aggregates sentiment scores weighted by relevance

### How It Works Now
When you analyze a stock like TSLA:
1. Fetches last 50 news articles mentioning TSLA
2. Extracts sentiment scores for TSLA specifically
3. Calculates weighted average sentiment (-1 to +1 scale)
4. Shows in the News tab with:
   - Overall sentiment score
   - Number of articles analyzed
   - Recent headlines with individual scores

### Sentiment Score Interpretation
- **> 0.3**: Positive sentiment 😊
- **-0.3 to 0.3**: Neutral sentiment 😐
- **< -0.3**: Negative sentiment 😟

### Entry Condition Impact
- **Sentiment < -0.5**: Blocks entry (very negative news)
- **Sentiment > 0.3**: Adds confidence to entry
- **Otherwise**: No impact on entry decision

### Example Output
```
News Sentiment Analysis

The news sentiment is now fully integrated and will help you avoid entering trades before bad news or gain confidence from positive sentiment!
