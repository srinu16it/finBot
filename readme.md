# LangGraph Stock Pattern Analyzer

A modular, AI-enhanced stock analysis tool built with Python, LangGraph, and OpenAI GPT-4. It fetches live stock data, detects technical chart patterns, computes indicators, and uses an LLM to summarize market outlook in natural language.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live OHLCV data via Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- ✅ Technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, VWAP)
- ✅ Pattern detection nodes:
  - Double Top / Bottom
  - Triple Top / Bottom
  - Head & Shoulders / Inverse H&S
  - Rising / Falling Wedge
  - Bullish / Bearish Pennants
  - Bullish / Bearish Flags
  - Ascending / Descending / Symmetrical Triangles
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 LLM summary with reasoning
- ✅ LangGraph-powered execution with memory and trace
- ✅ Transparent LLM prompt logging to files

## 🧱 Architecture

```
User Input
   ↓
Extract Symbol
   ↓
[LangGraph Flow]
   → API Fetch (OHLCV)
   → Analysis Summary
   → Indicator Calculation
   → Pattern Detection (7 types)
   → LLM Reasoning (OpenAI GPT-4)
   ↓
Final Report (Market Direction + Trace)
```

All nodes operate within a shared `State` dictionary using LangGraph's `StateGraph` abstraction. LangGraph provides:

- Type-safe flow definitions using `TypedDict`
- Visualizable graph structure
- Built-in memory management (`MemorySaver` for trace)
- Sequential and conditional edge control

Each node modifies the shared state and passes it along to the next. The flow ends with the LLM reason node that reads all indicators and patterns.
